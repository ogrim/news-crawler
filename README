# news-crawler

A tool I use to get data for research on my master's thesis. In fact, it is not a crawler at all; it's a scraper. So if you use this, you should be kind and don't hammer anyone, also don't do illegal things with other peoples data.

## Usage

Configure the global vars, and run the scrape-function.
